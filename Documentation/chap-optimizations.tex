\section{Static single assignment form}

While not an optimization in itself, static single assignment (SSA)
form is a prerequisite for many optimization techniques, which is why
we describe it here. 

In their conference paper from 2013
\cite{Braun:2013:SEC:2450247.2450258}, Braun et al present an
algorithm capable of a direct translation of abstract syntax trees to
SSA form.  We do not use it here, because we have not been able to
couple it with our compilation context which seems to require
compilation from the end to the beginning of the program. 

Instead, we use the traditional technique based on \emph{iterated
  dominance frontiers}.
