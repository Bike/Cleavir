\section{MIR interpreter}

\sysname{} provides a backend that can run in a \commonlisp{} system,
either intrinsically or extrinsically.  This backend is mainly used
in order to test that generated MIR code yields the expected result. 

The MIR interpreter works as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The MIR code is translated to a \commonlisp{} program.  This
  program contains a lambda expression for each nested function.  The
  outermost lambda expression has no parameters.
\item The lambda expression is converted to a function using
  \texttt{compile}. 
\item The resulting function is executed by passing it to
  \texttt{funcall}. 
\end{itemize}
