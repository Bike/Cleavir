;;; Datum class IMMEDIATE-INPUT.
;;;
;;; The IMMEDIATE-INPUT datum corresponds to a raw machine interger
;;; that is considered sufficiently small that it can occur directly
;;; in the instruction stream.  The machine integer is represented in
;;; the instance as a Lisp integer.  The machine integer can represent
;;; some raw numeric information, or it can represent a tagged
;;; immediate Lisp datum such as a fixnum or a character. 
;;;
;;; Data of this type are introduced by backend-specific code,
;;; because whether or not some datum can be represented as immediate
;;; input depends on the backend.

;;; Datum class WORD-INPUT.
;;;
;;; The WORD-INPUT datum corresponds to a raw machine interger that
;;; may or may not be sufficiently small to occur directly in the
;;; instruction stream.  The machine integer is represented in the
;;; instance as a Lisp integer.  The machine integer can represent
;;; some raw numeric information, or it can represent a tagged
;;; immediate Lisp datum such as a fixnum or a character.
;;;
;;; Data of this type are introduced in early compilation stages
;;; when a WORD-AST is compiled, and in later stages when
;;; backend-specific code determins that a Lisp constant has a
;;; representation as a machine word, typically a character constant.
;;; Notice that such as character constant may or may not be possible
;;; to represent as an immediate input, depending on the Unicode code
;;; point of the character, and depending on the magnitude of
;;; immediates that the bacend can handle.
