;;;; In the Cleavir intermediate representation, an AST representing a
;;;; top-level form is compiled into FLOWCHART.  A flowchart is a
;;;; graph in which the nodes are INSTRUCTIONS and DATA.  There are
;;;; two types of arcs: CONTROL ARCS and DATA ACRS.
;;;;
;;;; A CONTROL ARC represents the flow of control in the flowchart,
;;;; and connects one instruction to another instruction.  If there is
;;;; a control arc from an instruction I to an instruction J in a
;;;; flowchart, then J is said to be A SUCCESSOR of I, and I is said
;;;; to be A PREDECESSOR of J.  An instruction can have zero, one, or
;;;; several successors.  Most instructions have a single successor.
;;;; Some instruction types such as RETURN instructions have no
;;;; successors.  Instruction types with two or more successors
;;;; represent some kind of test that can have more than one outcome.
;;;; An instruction can have zero, one, or several predecessors.  If
;;;; an instruction has no predecessors, then it is an INITIAL
;;;; INSTRUCTION of some subgraph of the flowchart, and then it can
;;;; only be reached by CALLING it, as opposed to by the ordinary flow
;;;; of control.  The entire flowchart is represented by such an
;;;; initial instruction.
;;;;
;;;; A DATA ARC represents the input to or the output from an
;;;; instruction.  A data arc with an instruction as its HEAD is an
;;;; INPUT ARC.  A data arc with an instruction as its TAIL is an
;;;; OUTPUT ARC.  The HEAD of an output arc is always a DATUM that can
;;;; be written to.  The TAIL of an input arc is usually a DATUM,
;;;; except that the input to an ENCLOSE instruction is the INITIAL
;;;; INSTRUCTION of some subgraph.  The output of that same ENCLOSE
;;;; instruction is a CLOSURE that, when called, transfers control to
;;;; the initial instruction that is the input of the enclose
;;;; instruction.
;;;;
;;;; An instruction J is said to be REACHABLE from some instruction I
;;;; if and only if there is a (possibly empty) sequence of control
;;;; arcs that corresponds to a path from I to J.

;;;
;;; Class DATUM.  
;;;
;;; This is the root class of all different kinds of data.
