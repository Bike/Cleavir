The `cleavir-io` system defines a macro `define-save-info` that can be used to record what information is required to reconstruct a standard object. This save info is used throughout Cleavir to make objects serializable either as text (via `print-model-object`, `read-model-object`) or by `compile-file` with `make-load-form`. Reader macro syntax is used, so that for example `[foo :bar baz]` can be used as the textual representation of an object of class `foo` with one slot value.
