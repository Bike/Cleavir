;;;; We use a canonical representation of the type of a variable.
;;;;
;;;; Baker's paper on SUBTYPEP suggests that it is not necessary to
;;;; canonicalize the representation of the type, and it is probably
;;;; best not to do so when SUBTYPEP is called a single time at
;;;; run-time.  However, in the type inferencer, the requirements are
;;;; quite different.  We frequently need to compute the union,
;;;; intersection, and difference of types, as well as many
;;;; compositions of these operations.  In that situation it is
;;;; probably better to use a canonical representation to avoid that
;;;; the size of the representation grow after each operation.
